## About

## Install

i do **not** know why'd you want to install this, it's so useless.

anyways, here is the npm command to install it.

```sh
npm install @unifiton/kantanni@0.0.2
```
or you can add this to your dependencies in your package.json

```json
"@unifiton/kantanni": "version - currently only 0.0.1 & 0.0.2"
```

you **CANNOT** at this time install kantanni without putting the @unifiton/ in front of it, i'll look into that.

kantanni can be installed from the Github Package Registry.

then again, why would you want to install this?
