# b2fp 

What is b2fp? It's another useless NPM module!!!
Truly, it's meant to make my life easier, but you don't need it.

**b2fp is a rewrite of kanta, with more logical and reasonable features.**
**b2fp will remain in the rewrite branch.**

I'll be moving b2fp to the `live` branch once it's `stable` enough (version 2.0 is stable for this project), then it'll be moved to the `dev` branch and then the `stable` branch in which it'll be posted to the npm repository under "kanta" installable under `npm install kanta` 

This can be installed in current-state with `npm install b2fp`

You can install the broken "stable" kanta with `npm i kanta` still.
b2fp will assume kanta versioning schematic and will be version 1.0.0 of kanta. (kanta is on 0.0.15 as of right now)
