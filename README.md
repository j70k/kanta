## About
this is... very useless.

it doesn't have much to it.

please spare your time and don't install this...

## Install

i do **not** know why'd you want to install this, it's so useless.

anyways, here is the npm command to install it.

```sh
npm install soti
```
or you can add this to your dependencies in your package.json

```json
"soti": "0.0.1"
```


soti can be installed from the NPM Package Registry.

then again, why would you want to install this?
