# b2fp 

What is b2fp? It's another useless NPM module!!!
Truly, it's meant to make my life easier, but you don't need it.

**b2fp is a rewrite of kanta, with more logical and reasonable features.**
**b2fp will remain in the rewrite branch.**

I'll be moving b2fp to the live branch once it's stable enough, then it'll be moved to the dev branch and then the stable branch in which it'll be posted to the npm repository under "kanta"(version 2.0 is stable for this project)

This can be installed in current-state with `npm install b2fp`

[insert more interesting stuff here :>]
