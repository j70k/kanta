# b2fp 

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/b2fp.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/b2fp/)

What is b2fp? It's another useless NPM module!!!
Truly, it's meant to make my life easier, but you don't need it.

**b2fp is a rewrite of kanta, with more logical and reasonable features.**
**b2fp will remain in the rewrite branch.**

This branch *will* be merged into dev once it is *stable* and has most of the planned features functioning or semi-functioning.

b2fp will most likely, when published onto the live branch, will be version 1.0.0. 

- Get functions working and setup
- Basic echo function (example: b2fp.echo("hi there"); => local@local % hi there)
- Read/Write to JSON
- Read/Write to TXT
- Rename, delete, create files
- Downloader test
